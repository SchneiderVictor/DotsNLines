# DotsNLines
My first Android project! A simple 2-player game of Dots and Lines.

Game Rules
==========

1. Players take turns placing lines between dots, these are their moves.
2. Points are awarded to the player whose move forms a 1x1 square.
3. Whenever a player earns a point, they are awarded an additional turn.
4. The winner is decided once all possible lines are placed.

Disclaimer
----------

This game is purely an Android Studio project. An APK will be generated once I feel it is more stable.

Until then, the game must be launched through android studio (either on emulator or any android  phone running 8.1+)

What I've learned thus far
-----------------

- Some better xml layout techniques (vertical/horizontal bias)
- How to dynamically add/modify views
