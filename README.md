# DotsNLines
My first Android project! A simple 2-player game of Dots and Lines.

Game Rules
==========

1. Players take turns placing lines between dots, these are their moves.
2. Points are awarded to the player whose move forms a 1x1 square.
3. Whenever a player earns a point, they are awarded an additional turn.
4. The winner is decided once all possible lines are placed.

This game is purely an Android Studio project. An APK will be generated once I feel it is more stable.
